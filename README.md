# GreenGauge

Project GreenGauge was an android application made for the NTU Singapore India Hackathon 2023 (https://www.singaporeindiahackathon.com/index.php). The problem statement pursued here was "Monitoring Carbon Footprint". As such, this app tracks carbon footprint through vehicle emissions in an effort to educate consumers on the carbon effect of their driving habits. This app features a database to store daily driving statistics and a graph to visualize the user's carbon footprint through driving over time. In addition, the app has statistics on the real-world effect of the user's driving habit.

Features include:
◉ In-depth carbon footprint emission calculator
◉ Modern UI/UX design
◉ Safe storage of data using a database 
◉ Line Chart graph to summarize emission
◉ Emission statement
◉ 6 recommendations to reduce one's carbon footprint
◉ Delete, Add and View past carbon footprint inputs
